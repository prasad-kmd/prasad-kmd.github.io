            The F-35, conversely, is a multi-role fighter designed for air
            superiority, strike missions and other roles, with stealth being a core
            design requirement. The F-35 is a technically advanced platform with many
            capabilities, although this has resulted in higher costs and more complex
            operations.</span>

            force in the coming years, the A-10 continues to be used and supported for
            its specialised close air support role. Both platforms will continue to
            play a crucial role in the US armed forces for years to come.</span>

                    What is the primary design philosophy behind the A-10
                    Thunderbolt II?

            <div class="pmbsweb-toggles-item--content">
                <p>The A-10 was specifically designed for close air support (CAS),
                    focusing on survivability and delivering heavy firepower at low
                    altitudes. Unlike traditional fighter jets that prioritise speed and
                    appearance, the A-10 is a rugged, purpose-built aircraft designed to
                    effectively attack ground targets, particularly tanks and armoured
                    vehicles. Its design prioritises manoeuvrability, allowing it to
                    operate close to friendly ground forces, and it is heavily armoured
                    to withstand ground fire, making it exceptionally resilient in
                    combat. It was the first USAF fighter specifically designed for the
                    close air support role.</p>

                    What makes the A-10 so survivable in combat?
                </h4>
            </div>
            <div class="pmbsweb-toggles-item--content">
                <p>The A-10 incorporates numerous design features for survivability. It
                    has a titanium "bathtub" surrounding the cockpit, protecting the
                    pilot from small arms fire and fragments. Its high-mounted engines
                    are positioned away from the main fuselage and wings, reducing their
                    vulnerability to ground fire. The aircraft has redundant flight
                    control systems, meaning if one is damaged, another system can take
                    over, and it can still fly with damaged control surfaces. The
                    aircraft is designed to be able to fly with a single engine, one
                    tail, one elevator, and one aileron damaged. Also, many A-10s
                    feature a false canopy painted on the underside of the aircraft to
                    confuse the enemy about its attitude and direction.</p>

                </h4>
            </div>
            <div class="pmbsweb-toggles-item--content">
                <p>The GAU-8 Avenger is a 30mm Gatling-style cannon designed
                    specifically for destroying tanks and armoured vehicles. It is a
                    powerful and highly effective weapon system that makes the A-10
                    uniquely suited for its role as a tank-killer. The cannon's immense
                    recoil is handled through the aircraft's structure, and the design
                    of the aircraft was essentially built around this weapon. The GAU-8
                    also produces a distinctive sound when firing.</p>

                    How did the A-10's initial reception within the USAF
                    differ from its eventual adoption?
                </h4>
            </div>
            <div class="pmbsweb-toggles-item--content">
                <p> Initially, many USAF pilots were reluctant to fly the A-10 because
                    it was slower and considered less prestigious than traditional
                    fighter jets. Fighter pilots often valued speed and sleek aircraft
                    designs. However, over time, the A-10 demonstrated its effectiveness
                    and unique capabilities in close air support. As its performance in
                    combat became evident and ground troops grew to appreciate the
                    support it provided, attitudes changed, and the A-10 became a valued
                    and integral asset. Some A-10s were also redesignated as OA-10s,
                    taking on a Forward Air Control (FAC) role, with minor equipment
                    changes while maintaining full combat capabilities.</p>

                <p> The A-10C is a significant upgrade of the original A-10A. The A-10C
                    has received digital avionics upgrades, which includes new
                    multi-function displays, a modern fire control system, and improved
                    sensors, giving the A-10C greatly improved weapons targeting and
                    data sharing capabilities. These upgrades have made the A-10 more
                    effective on modern battlefields. The A-10C also incorporates the
                    Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, which greatly expands the aircraft's
                    precision targeting and situational awareness.</p>

                </h4>
            </div>
            <div class="pmbsweb-toggles-item--content">
                <p>The F-35 is a multirole stealth strike fighter designed to perform
                    air superiority, strike missions, electronic warfare and
                    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks. It emphasises
                    advanced sensor fusion, network-centric capabilities, and stealth,
                    making it a 5th-generation fighter. This contrasts heavily with the
                    A-10's design principles, which prioritise close air support,
                    ruggedness, and firepower at low altitudes. While the F-35 has some
                    ground attack capabilities, it was not designed for the same
                    intense, low-altitude close support role as the A-10. The F-35 also
                    makes extensive use of internal weapons bays to maintain its stealth
                    profile, whereas the A-10 can carry more external weapons.</p>

            <div class="pmbsweb-toggles-item--content">
                <p>The F-35 has three main variants: the F-35A, a conventional takeoff
                    and landing (CTOL) version; the F-35B, a short takeoff and vertical
                    landing (STOVL) version, and the F-35C, a carrier-based
                    catapult-assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) version.
                    The F-35A is designed for land-based operations. The F-35B, with its
                    STOVL capability, is designed to operate from smaller carriers and
                    austere bases. The F-35C features a larger wing and is specifically
                    designed to operate from aircraft carriers with catapult systems and
                    arresting gear. The variants have different weights, fuel capacities
                    and payload capacities, with the F-35B having the lowest payload and
                    range due to the lift systems required for its STOVL capabilities.</p>
